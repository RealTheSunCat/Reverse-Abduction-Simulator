**Oh no! You deleted all of the humans from Earth!** Add them back before your boss returns from his coffee break, but be careful with what you add⁠—you could end up causing chaos.

Your boss will come to check on the planet in 2:30. That means that you have **150 seconds** to repopulate the planet with as many people as possible. The only issue is... your HUMAN GENERATOR™ is buggy. Releasing a buggy human means mass destruction of the people. That's bad! **How high can you get the population before time runs out?**

Borderless fullscreen can be toggled with the F11 key.
